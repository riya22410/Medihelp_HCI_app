### Problem Statement
Non-availability of a platform that enables its users to explore the various medical services in their area often ends up resulting in them choosing the incorrect option, i.e., the more expensive or inconvenient option. This may even end up in fatalities.

### Background of the Problem and Motivation
The costs of medical services like MRI, CT Scan, transplants, surgeries, etc., are increasing at a fast rate, and people not having a platform to explore their options results in them choosing the more expensive ones.
Not having access to all possible options causes significant inconvenience for the patients and may result in fatalities.
We want to ensure that people get good quality medical services at the most economical cost nearby. 
Moreover, we want to allow its users to compare all available medical centres/labs and filter out the options like costs, success rate, distance from their current location, reviews, etc., according to their needs. 

### Scope
Getting in touch with medical services quickly at low costs will not only ease people’s lives but also save them.
The aspects that our solution aims to cover are:
Making the process of finding the ideal medical center more convenient, primarily through the filter option, which will help users sort through the available services as per their needs.
We aim to make medical centers and their services more accessible to the general public.
Providing various options to the users right at their fingertips. By doing so, users will get the opportunity to explore and find exemplary medical services in time.
